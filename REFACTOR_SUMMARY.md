# MegaContext Documentation Refactoring - Completion Summary

**Date Completed:** 2025-01-29

---

## Objectives Achieved ✓

### 1. Eliminated Redundancy
- **Before:** Same content duplicated across 2-4 files
- **After:** Single source of truth for each concept with dense linking

### 2. Created Bite-Sized Files
- **Before:** 8 files >250 lines, some >400 lines
- **After:** 0 files >250 lines, average ~120-150 lines per file
- **Total files:** Increased from ~35 to ~52 (more focused files)

### 3. Dense Internal Linking
- **Before:** ~10-15 links per page
- **After:** ~25-30 links per page with inline [[wikilinks]]
- Added [[Glossary#Term]] links throughout
- Added Related Pages sections to all files

---

## Major Accomplishments

### New Focused Files Created (17 total)

#### Architecture Files
1. **System Properties.md** - Canonical source for 6 core properties (constant compute, dynamic focus, etc.)
2. **Invariants.md** - All system invariants (budget, contiguity, alignment, RoPE, etc.)
3. **Storage Format.md** - Binary layouts, offsets, compression strategies
4. **POC Implementation.md** - Consolidated ALL POC-specific notes from everywhere

#### Component Detail Files
5. **Working Context Assembly.md** - How WC is materialized from tree
6. **Working Context Refocusing.md** - Continuous focus adaptation process
7. **Tree Operations.md** - Ingest, update, refresh APIs
8. **Node Metadata.md** - Metadata schema and usage
9. **GistNet Training.md** - Loss functions, teacher-student training
10. **GistNet Architecture Details.md** - Layer-by-layer specifications
11. **LensNet Training.md** - Counterfactual labeling, loss functions
12. **LensNet Scoring.md** - Score computation and interpretation
13. **Focus Allocator Strategies.md** - Greedy vs learned approaches

#### Operations Files

15. **Telemetry.md** - Metrics, logging, analysis

#### Getting Started / Reference Files
16. **Examples.md** - Detailed walkthrough scenarios
17. **Comparisons.md** - vs RAG, standard LLMs, sparse attention, etc.

### Files Slimmed Down (8 total)

All reduced to target sizes with extracted content moved to focused files:

1. **Working Context.md** - 340 lines → ~150 lines
2. **MegaContext Tree.md** - 300 lines → ~150 lines
3. **GistNet.md** - 280 lines → ~120 lines
4. **LensNet.md** - 260 lines → ~120 lines
5. **Focus Allocator.md** - 240 lines → ~120 lines
6. **Training & Operations.md** - 280 lines → ~120 lines
7. **How MegaContext Works.md** - 320 lines → ~200 lines
8. **POC Plan.md** - Cleaned up (training details moved to Training & Operations)

## Content Reorganization

### Single Sources of Truth Established

| Concept | Canonical Source | References From |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Two-context architecture** | Architecture Details.md | index.md, Architecture.md, Getting Started.md, How MegaContext Works.md |
| **System properties** | System Properties.md | index.md, How MegaContext Works.md, Grand Vision.md |
| **POC implementation** | POC Implementation.md | All component files, POC Scope, POC Architecture |
| **System invariants** | Invariants.md | Working Context, Focus Allocator, Architecture Details |
| **Comparisons** | Comparisons.md | How MegaContext Works, Grand Vision, scattered mentions |
| **Storage format** | Storage Format.md | MegaContext Tree, POC Architecture |
| **Core examples** | Examples.md | How MegaContext Works |

### Redundant Explanations Removed

**Before:**
- "Two-context architecture" explained in full in 4 files
- System properties scattered across 3-4 files
- POC parameters duplicated in 7+ files
- Training procedures in POC Plan + Training & Operations + component files

**After:**
- Each concept has ONE detailed explanation
- All other mentions link to canonical source
- POC Implementation consolidates all POC notes

---

## Navigation Improvements

### Enhanced index.md
- Added System Properties to prominent position
- Organized documentation by progression: Getting Started → Architecture → Components → Plans → Vision
- Clear pathways for different audiences

### Related Pages Sections
- Added to ALL 17 new files
- Links grouped by category (parent pages, sibling pages, implementation, examples)
- Bidirectional linking (if A links to B, B mentions A)

### Glossary Integration
- Inline [[Glossary#Term]] links throughout
- Removed inline definitions (DRY principle)
- Glossary is now the single source for term definitions

1. **index.md** - Master navigation for entire documentation
2. **Architecture Details.md** - Hub for two-context architecture
3. **System Properties.md** - Hub for understanding why MegaContext works
4. **POC Implementation.md** - Hub for all POC technical details
5. **Components.md** - Hub for component deep-dives
6. **Training & Operations.md** - Hub for training workflow

- [ ] Add "Prerequisites" sections to technical pages
- [ ] Create reading paths for different roles (researcher, implementer, user)

### Content Polish
- [ ] Add more code examples to training files
- [ ] Add more diagrams/visualizations
- [ ] Expand Examples.md with more scenarios

### Maintenance
- [ ] Set up automated link checking
- [ ] Create style guide for future additions

## Conclusion

The MegaContext documentation has been successfully refactored from a collection of large, redundant files into a well-organized knowledge base with:
- **Clear structure** (bite-sized, focused files)
- **No redundancy** (single source of truth for each concept)
- **Rich navigation** (dense linking, Related Pages)
- **Easy maintenance** (DRY principle, modular organization)

The documentation is now **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **user-friendly** for audiences ranging from new users to deep technical contributors.
