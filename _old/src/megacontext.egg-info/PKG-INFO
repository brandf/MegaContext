# MegaContext — Learned Context Compression & Focus for Frozen LLMs

*A system architecture for virtualized LLM memory.*

---

## TL;DR — MegaContext
MegaContext virtualizes context by pairing a disk-backed gist tree called the MegaContext Tree with a budgeted working context governed by GistNet, LensNet, and the Focus Allocator.

It separates a model’s context into a MegaContext Tree (stored on disk) and a Working Context (on GPU). A learned GistNet model is used to build the MegaContext Tree as a hierarchy of gists. The working context compresses the MegaContext Tree into a fixed-size mix of tokens and gists that are used for inference.

To dynamically adapt level of detail, a learned LensNet model, continuously/incrementally refocuses the MegaContext Tree onto the Working Context, giving the model effectively infinite memory at constant compute with automatic context management.
