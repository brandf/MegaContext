## Overview

### What the Paper Introduces

The Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) extends [[Neural Turing Machines]] with three critical innovations that enable complex reasoning, question answering, and graph traversal:

1. **Temporal Link Matrix**: Tracks write order, enabling forward/backward navigation through memory write history
2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Automated usage tracking and free list management for efficient memory reuse
3. **Multi-Head Read Architecture**: Multiple independent read heads with different addressing strategies

These additions allow DNC to solve tasks requiring explicit temporal reasoning and structured memory management—capabilities that were difficult or impossible for the original NTM.

### Key Innovation

The **temporal link matrix** `L[i,j]` records the degree to which location `i` was written after location `j`. This enables:
- **Forward traversal**: Following the sequence of writes (`w_t → w_{t+1} → w_{t+2}`)
- **Backward traversal**: Rewinding through write history (`w_t → w_{t-1} → w_{t-2}`)

Combined with **content-based addressing**, this creates a powerful hybrid addressing mechanism that can both search by similarity and navigate by temporal relationships.

### Key Results

1. **Graph Reasoning**: Successfully traversed family trees, London Underground maps, and random graphs with perfect accuracy on complex queries
2. **Block Puzzle**: Solved planning tasks requiring multi-step lookahead
3. **Mini-SHRDLU**: Answered questions about spatial relationships and object manipulations
4. **Question Answering**: Achieved strong performance on bAbI dataset (16/20 tasks solved)
5. **Generalization**: Demonstrated zero-shot transfer to longer sequences and larger graphs than seen during training

DNCs significantly outperformed LSTMs, NTMs, and other memory-augmented networks on tasks requiring structured reasoning over long timescales.

## Core Technical Concepts

### 1. Architecture Overview

```
Controller Network (LSTM)
       ↓
Read Heads (R=1-4) ← Temporal Links ← Write Head
       ↓                    ↓              ↓
   Memory Matrix M[N × W] (with usage tracking)
       ↓
Output via Read Vectors
```

**Components:**
- **Controller**: LSTM that processes input and generates memory interface parameters
- **Memory Matrix M**: `N × W` matrix (N locations, W dimensions per location)
- **Write Head**: Single head that writes to memory and updates temporal links
- **Read Heads**: Multiple heads (typically 1-4) with independent addressing
- **Usage Vector u**: Tracks which locations have been written/retained
- **Temporal Link Matrix L**: `N × N` matrix tracking write order
- **Precedence Vector p**: Stores most recent write weighting

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation

DNC tracks memory usage to automatically allocate and free memory locations:

**Usage Vector Update:**
```
u_t[i] = (u_{t-1}[i] + w_t^w[i] - u_{t-1}[i] · w_t^w[i]) · ψ_t[i]
```

Where:
- `w_t^w[i]` = write weight at location i
- `ψ_t[i]` = retention scalar (1 = keep, 0 = free)

**Free Gates:**
Each read head emits a free gate `f_t^i ∈ [0,1]` indicating whether the last-read location should be freed:
```
ψ_t[i] = ∏_{j=1}^R (1 - f_t^j · w_{t-1}^{r,j}[i])
```

**Allocation Weighting:**
Unused locations (low usage) are prioritized for writing:
```
a_t[i] ∝ (1 - u_t[i]) · ∏_{j=1}^{i-1} u_t[j]
```

This produces a "free list" ordering, allocating the least-recently-used available location.

### 3. Temporal Link Matrix

The link matrix `L[i,j]` represents the degree to which location `i` was written immediately after location `j`.

**Link Update:**
```
L_t[i,j] = (1 - w_t^w[i] - w_t^w[j]) · L_{t-1}[i,j] + w_t^w[i] · p_{t-1}[j]
```

Where:
- `p_t[j]` = precedence vector (write weighting from previous step)
- Decay term ensures old links fade
- New link term connects current write to previous write locations

**Precedence Update:**
```
p_t = (1 - Σ w_t^w) · p_{t-1} + w_t^w
```

### 4. Read Addressing with Temporal Links

Each read head combines three addressing modes:

**Content-Based Addressing:**
```
c_t^i = softmax(K(k_t^i, M_t))
```
Uses cosine similarity with sharpening (same as NTM).

**Forward Weighting:**
```
f_t^i = L_t^T · w_{t-1}^{r,i}
```
Follows temporal links forward from previous read location.

**Backward Weighting:**
```
b_t^i = L_t · w_{t-1}^{r,i}
```
Follows temporal links backward from previous read location.

**Final Read Weighting:**
```
w_t^{r,i} = π_t^i[1] · b_t^i + π_t^i[2] · c_t^i + π_t^i[3] · f_t^i
```

Where `π_t^i` is a learned 3-way softmax gating the three modes.

### 5. Write Addressing

Write location combines content-based addressing with allocation:

```
w_t^w = g_t^a · a_t + (1 - g_t^a) · c_t^w
```

Where:
- `g_t^a ∈ [0,1]` = allocation gate (learned)
- `a_t` = allocation weighting (from usage tracking)
- `c_t^w` = content-based weighting (similarity-based)

This allows the controller to choose between:
- **Writing to new locations** (high `g_t^a`) for fresh information
- **Overwriting similar content** (low `g_t^a`) for updates/corrections

### 6. Memory Operations

**Read Operation:**
```
r_t^i = Σ_j w_t^{r,i}[j] · M_t[j]
```
Standard weighted read (same as NTM).

**Write Operation:**
```
M_t[j] = M_{t-1}[j] · (1 - w_t^w[j] · e_t) + w_t^w[j] · v_t
```

Where:
- `e_t` = erase vector (what to forget)
- `v_t` = write vector (what to add)

Same erase-then-add mechanism as NTM.

## Relevance to MegaContext

### Direct Architectural Parallels

| DNC Component | MegaContext Analog | Parallel |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Memory Matrix M** | [[MegaContext Tree]] (L0/L1/L2 nodes) | External memory storage |
| **Read Heads** | [[LensNet]] + [[Working Context]] | Selective memory access |
| **Write Head** | [[GistNet]] (creating L1/L2 nodes) | Memory compression/storage |
| **Temporal Links L** | Tree parent-child pointers + temporal ordering | Structural relationships |
| **Usage Vector u** | Node metadata (access frequency, recency) | Memory management |
| **Allocation Mechanism** | [[Focus Allocator]] budget management | Resource allocation |
| **Controller** | Base model + system orchestration | Processing and control |

### Temporal Link Relevance

DNC's temporal linking mechanism directly addresses a challenge in MegaContext:

**Problem**: When [[LensNet]] scores working-context entries for focus adjustment, it lacks explicit information about temporal relationships between distant spans.

**DNC Solution**: The link matrix enables efficient forward/backward traversal through write history, allowing navigation between temporally related memories.

**MegaContext Adaptation**:
1. **Explicit temporal metadata**: Augment [[Node Metadata]] with "written-after" relationships
2. **Temporal attention bias**: Add learned biases in [[LensNet]] that favor temporally adjacent spans
3. **Sequential coherence reward**: Penalize focus layouts that create temporal discontinuities
4. **Refocusing hints**: Use temporal links to suggest which spans to expand/collapse together

### Dynamic Allocation Insights

DNC's usage tracking provides a principled approach to memory management:

**Usage Vector → Focus Metadata:**
- Track **access frequency** per node (how often expanded to working context)
- Track **read recency** (time since last access)
- Track **utility scores** (historical ΔNLL impact)

**Free List → Budget Allocation:**
- Prioritize expanding **recently accessed but currently collapsed** spans
- Deprioritize **never-accessed or low-utility** spans
- Implement **LRU-style eviction** when working context is full

**Allocation Gate → Expand/Collapse Gating:**
- Learn when to **create new gist nodes** (allocation) vs. **reuse existing gists** (content-based)
- Parallel: Learn when to **expand local detail** vs. **maintain current focus**

### Multi-Read Head Strategy

DNC uses multiple read heads with **different addressing strategies**:

**Read Head Specialization:**
- Head 1: Pure content-based (similarity search)
- Head 2: Forward temporal (following narrative flow)
- Head 3: Backward temporal (looking at context/history)
- Head 4: Mixed strategy

**MegaContext Application:**
This maps directly to [[Focus Architectures#Multi-Head Focus (MHF)|Multi-Head Focus (MHF)]] strategy:
- **WC-Head 1**: Content-focused (high similarity to current query)
- **WC-Head 2**: Temporally local (recent context)
- **WC-Head 3**: Structurally relevant (function definitions, class context)
- **WC-Head 4**: Cross-referential (related but distant spans)

Each head would use the same [[LensNet]] backbone but with different:
- Conditioning signals (query embeddings, structural hints)
- Focus score thresholds (τ_expand, τ_collapse)
- Temporal biases

---

## What We Can Use

### 1. Temporal Link Metadata

**Implementation:**
```python
@dataclass
class NodeMetadata:
    # Existing fields...
    written_after: list[int]  # Node IDs written immediately after this one
    write_order: int          # Global write sequence number
    temporal_neighbors: list[tuple[int, float]]  # (node_id, link_strength)
```

**Usage in LensNet:**
- Add temporal distance features: `|node_i.write_order - node_j.write_order|`
- Add temporal link attention: Bias cross-attention when nodes are temporally linked
- Reward coherent refocusing: Prefer expanding/collapsing consecutive write sequences

**Training Signal:**
Generate counterfactual labels where temporally linked spans are expanded/collapsed together, measuring joint ΔNLL@H.

### 2. Usage-Based Focus Allocation

**Track Node Usage:**
```python
@dataclass
class NodeMetadata:
    usage_score: float        # 0 = never accessed, 1 = always in WC
    last_access_step: int     # When last expanded to working context
    access_frequency: int     # Total expansions
    utility_history: list[float]  # Historical ΔNLL improvements
```

**Focus Allocator Enhancement:**
```python
def compute_allocation_priority(node: Node, current_step: int) -> float:
    """DNC-style allocation priority for expansion."""
    recency = 1.0 / (current_step - node.metadata.last_access_step + 1)
    frequency_norm = node.metadata.access_frequency / max_access_frequency
    avg_utility = mean(node.metadata.utility_history[-5:])  # Recent utility

    # Low usage + high historical utility = high priority
    # (like DNC's allocation to unused locations)
    return (1 - node.metadata.usage_score) * avg_utility + λ * recency
```

**Budget Management:**
When `sum(WC_cost) > W_max`:
1. Compute allocation priority for all collapsed candidate spans
2. Compute retention priority for all expanded spans (inverse of "free gate")
3. **Collapse low-retention spans** to free budget
4. **Expand high-allocation-priority spans** with freed budget

### 3. Multi-Read Head Refocusing

**Architecture:**
```python
class MultiHeadLensNet:
    def __init__(self, num_heads: int = 3):
        self.shared_encoder = LensNetEncoder()  # Shared across heads
        self.head_decoders = [
            LensNetDecoder(conditioning_dim=d, specialization=spec)
            for spec in ["content", "temporal-forward", "temporal-backward"]
        ]

    def forward(self, wc_entries, query_emb, temporal_links):
        shared_features = self.shared_encoder(wc_entries)

        head_outputs = []
        for decoder, links in zip(self.head_decoders, temporal_links):
            # Each head gets different conditioning
            head_scores = decoder(shared_features, query_emb, links)
            head_outputs.append(head_scores)

        # Merge strategies: max, mean, learned gating
        return merge_head_scores(head_outputs)
```

**Specialization Strategies:**
- **Content head**: Pure similarity-based focus (like DNC's content addressing)
- **Forward head**: Prefer spans immediately after current focus (following narrative)
- **Backward head**: Prefer spans immediately before current focus (context retrieval)

### 4. Write Allocation Gate for Gisting

**DNC Insight**: The allocation gate `g_a` decides between writing to new vs. existing locations.

**MegaContext Adaptation**: Learn a gate that decides between:
- **Creating new gist nodes** (high allocation): Fresh information, distinct content
- **Refining existing gists** (low allocation): Updates, corrections, clarifications

```python
class GistNetWithAllocation:
    def forward(self, token_block, parent_gist=None):
        new_gist = self.gist_encoder(token_block)

        if parent_gist is not None:
            # Content-based similarity
            similarity = cosine_similarity(new_gist, parent_gist)

            # Learned allocation gate
            g_a = sigmoid(self.allocation_gate(new_gist, parent_gist))

            # Blend: allocate new vs. refine existing
            final_gist = g_a * new_gist + (1 - g_a) * refine(parent_gist, new_gist)
        else:
            final_gist = new_gist

        return final_gist
```

**Training**: Minimize ΔNLL@H for both allocation and refinement paths, with regularizers encouraging:
- **High allocation** when token block is semantically distinct from parent context
- **Low allocation** when token block continues/updates previous content

### 5. Forward/Backward Temporal Traversal

**Use Case**: When refocusing the working context, expand not just the highest-scored span, but also its temporal neighbors.

**Algorithm:**
```python
def temporal_coherent_expand(focus_scores, temporal_links, budget):
    """Expand spans with temporal coherence."""
    candidates = [idx for idx, score in enumerate(focus_scores) if score > τ_expand]

    # For each candidate, compute "cluster score" including temporal neighbors
    cluster_scores = {}
    for idx in candidates:
        forward_neighbors = temporal_links.forward(idx)   # Written after
        backward_neighbors = temporal_links.backward(idx)  # Written before

        # Cluster utility: sum of scores for temporally linked spans
        cluster_scores[idx] = (
            focus_scores[idx] +
            α * sum(focus_scores[n] for n in forward_neighbors) +
            β * sum(focus_scores[n] for n in backward_neighbors)
        )

    # Expand top clusters until budget exhausted
    sorted_clusters = sorted(cluster_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    expansions = []
    for idx, score in sorted_clusters:
        if can_afford(idx, budget):
            expansions.append(idx)
            budget -= cost(idx)

    return expansions
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces oscillation (expand/collapse of adjacent spans)
- Maintains narrative continuity
- Amortizes expansion cost across related content

### 6. Sharpening and Oscillation Control

DNC uses **sharpening** to focus attention (reducing oscillation):
```
w_sharpened[i] = w[i]^γ / Σ_j w[j]^γ
```

**MegaContext Application:**
Apply sharpening to [[LensNet]] focus scores before feeding to [[Focus Allocator]]:

```python
def sharpen_focus_scores(scores, gamma=2.0):
    """Increase contrast between high/low scores to reduce oscillation."""
    positive_scores = np.maximum(scores, 0)
    sharpened = positive_scores ** gamma
    return sharpened / (np.sum(sharpened) + 1e-8) * np.sum(positive_scores)
```

**Effect**: High-scoring spans get amplified, low-scoring spans suppressed → more decisive expand/collapse actions.

**Hyperparameter**:
- `γ = 1.0`: No sharpening (soft attention)
- `γ = 2.0-5.0`: Moderate sharpening (recommended)
- `γ → ∞`: Hard attention (one-hot, maximum decisiveness)

## Limitations & Risks

### 1. Computational Complexity

**DNC Limitation:**
- Temporal link matrix is `O(N²)` in memory size
- Link updates are `O(N²)` per timestep
- Scales poorly to large memory banks (N > 1000)

**MegaContext Context:**
- MegaContext Tree can have millions of nodes (N ~ 10⁶-10⁹)
- Full temporal link matrix is infeasible

**Mitigation:**
- **Sparse temporal links**: Only store links between temporally adjacent nodes (within ±K steps)
- **Hierarchical links**: Link structure follows tree hierarchy (parent-child + sibling links)
- **On-demand traversal**: Compute temporal paths dynamically when needed, don't precompute full matrix

### 2. Write-Once Memory Model

**DNC Limitation:**
DNC memory locations can be overwritten (erase + add), but the temporal link matrix assumes a relatively stable memory structure. Frequent overwrites can degrade link quality.

**MegaContext Context:**
MegaContext tree is **append-only** at L0, but gists are recomputed during training. This misalignment means:
- Temporal links based on initial creation order may not reflect updated gist semantics
- Gist refinement (updating existing nodes) breaks temporal order assumptions

**Mitigation:**
- **Link recomputation**: When gists are updated, recompute affected temporal links
- **Version tracking**: Store multiple gist versions per node, link temporally across versions
- **Semantic links**: Supplement temporal links with semantic similarity links (like NTM's content addressing)

### 3. Multi-Head Read Overhead

**DNC Limitation:**
Each read head performs independent content addressing, temporal traversal, and gating. With R heads, this multiplies computation by R.

**MegaContext Context:**
[[Focus Architectures#Multi-Head Focus (MHF)|Multi-Head Focus]] proposes multiple working contexts (e.g., 2-4 heads). Each head requires:
- Independent [[LensNet]] scoring pass
- Independent [[Focus Allocator]] planning
- Independent [[Working Context Assembly]]

This could **triple or quadruple** the computational cost of refocusing.

**Mitigation:**
- **Shared encoding**: Use a single [[LensNet]] encoder, only specialize the final scoring layer
- **Adaptive routing**: Learn which heads to activate (like Mixture of Experts gating)
- **Amortization**: Run multi-head refocusing less frequently (every 2-3K tokens instead of every K)

### 4. Training Complexity

**DNC Limitation:**
DNC requires **curriculum learning** to train successfully:
- Start with short, simple sequences
- Gradually increase sequence length and task complexity
- Without curriculum, training often diverges

**MegaContext Context:**
[[GistNet]] and [[LensNet]] also require careful training:
- GistNet: Needs token-to-gist alignment curriculum (see [[GistNet Training]])
- LensNet: Needs counterfactual label generation, which is computationally expensive

Adding DNC-style temporal linking and usage tracking increases training complexity:
- More hyperparameters (link decay rates, allocation gate initialization)
- More loss terms (temporal coherence, allocation regularizers)
- Longer training time (temporal patterns take longer to learn than content patterns)

**Mitigation:**
- **Staged training**: Train GistNet first (substitutability), then LensNet (focus), then temporal/allocation modules
- **Pretrain on synthetic tasks**: Use algorithmic tasks (copy, sort, graph traversal) to pretrain temporal modules
- **Frozen base model**: Keep base LLM frozen to reduce training instability

## Open Questions for MegaContext

### 1. Hybrid Soft/Hard Temporal Links

**Question**: Should temporal links be soft (weighted, like DNC) or hard (discrete pointers)?

**Trade-offs**:
- **Soft links**: Differentiable, gradual transitions, but computationally expensive (O(N²) updates)
- **Hard links**: Fast lookups (O(1) pointer traversal), but non-differentiable, binary decisions

**Exploration Path**:
- Start with **hard links** (tree parent-child + sibling pointers) for efficiency
- Add **learned soft biases** on top of hard structure (attention modulation)
- Experiment with **sparse soft links** (only top-K temporal neighbors get non-zero weights)

### 2. Temporal Coherence Regularization

**Question**: How strongly should [[Focus Allocator]] enforce temporal continuity in working context layouts?

**Approaches**:
- **Hard constraint**: Force working context to contain only temporally contiguous spans (no gaps)
- **Soft penalty**: Add loss term proportional to number of temporal discontinuities
- **Adaptive**: Learn when temporal coherence matters (e.g., high for narratives, low for Q&A)

**Metrics**:
- Measure ΔNLL@H for temporally coherent vs. fragmented working contexts
- Track oscillation rate (expand/collapse of temporally adjacent spans)

### 3. Multi-Head Focus Conditioning

**Question**: What conditioning signals should different [[Focus Architectures#Multi-Head Focus (MHF)|Multi-Head Focus]] heads use?

**DNC Analogy**:
- DNC read heads use same memory but different addressing mode weights (π for content/forward/backward)
- MegaContext heads could use different query embeddings, temporal biases, or structural hints

**Candidate Signals**:
- **Query embedding diversity**: Each head attends to different aspects of the query (keywords, semantic intent, syntax)
- **Temporal bias**: Head 1 = recent context (high temporal discount), Head 2 = distant context (low discount)
- **Structural hints**: Head 3 = function boundaries, Head 4 = cross-file references

**Open Research**:
- Can we learn head specialization end-to-end, or should it be hand-designed?
- How to merge outputs from heads with conflicting focus preferences?

### 4. Write Operations for Gist Refinement

**Question**: DNC has explicit write heads that modify memory. Should MegaContext support **gist updates** (overwriting existing L1/L2 nodes)?

**Current Design**: MegaContext tree is append-only (immutable gists).

**DNC-Inspired Alternative**:
- Add **gist refinement** operation: Update an existing L1 gist based on new information
- Use allocation gate to decide: create new child gist vs. refine parent gist
- Track **gist versions** (like DNC's temporal links) to maintain history

**Use Cases**:
- **Narrative correction**: Initial summary is vague, later context clarifies → refine L1 gist
- **Incremental learning**: Long document is processed in chunks, each chunk refines the document-level L2 gist
- **Error recovery**: Initial gist had high ΔNLL, refinement improves substitutability

**Risk**: Breaks immutability assumption, complicates training (how to backprop through gist updates?)

### 5. Usage-Based Pruning

**Question**: Should rarely accessed nodes be pruned from the [[MegaContext Tree]] to reduce memory footprint?

**DNC Analogy**: DNC's free gates allow memory locations to be deallocated and reused.

**MegaContext Context**:
- Tree can grow to billions of nodes
- Not all historical context is equally valuable
- Pruning could reduce storage/search costs

**Pruning Strategies**:
- **Usage threshold**: Prune nodes never expanded to working context after N tokens
- **Utility threshold**: Prune nodes with consistently negative or zero focus scores
- **Time-based**: Prune nodes older than T tokens (sliding window)

**Risk**: Irreversible information loss (unlike DNC's reusable memory slots)

**Mitigation**:
- **Two-tier storage**: Keep L0 tokens in cold storage (disk/archive), prune only gists
- **Lazy reconstruction**: Recompute gists on-demand if pruned node is later requested
- **Selective archiving**: Use reinforcement learning to decide which nodes to keep vs. prune

### 6. Temporal Link Sparsity

**Question**: How many temporal neighbors should each node track?

**DNC Baseline**: Full O(N²) link matrix (infeasible for MegaContext).

**Sparse Alternatives**:
- **Fixed window**: Each node links to ±K nearest temporal neighbors (e.g., K=32)
- **Hierarchical**: Each node links to siblings, parent, children (tree structure provides links)
- **Adaptive**: Learn how many links to maintain per node (high for important nodes, low for peripheral)

**Experiment**:
- Vary K from 0 (no temporal links) to 128 (dense temporal window)
- Measure ΔNLL@H and refocusing quality
- Find optimal K that balances memory cost and prediction quality

### 7. Allocation vs. Content-Based Gisting

**Question**: When creating L2 gists from 32 L1 gists, should [[GistNet]] always create a fresh L2, or sometimes update an existing L2?

**DNC Write Addressing**: Uses allocation gate `g_a` to blend new allocation and content-based overwrite.

**MegaContext Scenario**:
- Document has 1024 L1 gists (32 L2 gists)
- New chunk of 32 L1 gists arrives
- Options:
  1. **Always allocate**: Create L2_33 (new node)
  2. **Content-based update**: If new L1s are similar to existing L2_k, refine L2_k instead
  3. **Gated blend**: Learn when to allocate vs. refine

**Training**:
- Measure ΔNLL@H for both allocation and refinement
- Learn gate to minimize prediction error
- Regularize to prefer refinement when content is similar (reduce tree bloat)

### 8. Visualization and Interpretability

**Question**: DNC papers show attention weight visualizations (read/write patterns over time). How should MegaContext visualize focus dynamics?

**Visualizations**:
1. **Working context heatmap**: Show which nodes are expanded (L0/L1/L2) over time
2. **Temporal link graph**: Display temporal connections between nodes
3. **Focus trajectory**: Animate refocusing decisions as the base model processes tokens
4. **Utility attribution**: Highlight which nodes contributed most to prediction quality

**Use Cases**:
- **Debugging**: Identify oscillation patterns, focus bottlenecks, allocation failures
- **User interface**: Show users what context the model is "paying attention to"
- **Research**: Analyze learned focus strategies (content vs. temporal vs. structural)

## Summary

The Differentiable Neural Computer extends Neural Turing Machines with three key innovations—**temporal linking**, **dynamic memory allocation**, and **multi-head read operations**—that enable complex reasoning over structured memory. These concepts map directly onto MegaContext's architecture:

- **Temporal links** → Enhanced [[Node Metadata]] with write-order tracking
- **Dynamic allocation** → Usage-based [[Focus Allocator]] prioritization
- **Multi-read heads** → [[Focus Architectures#Multi-Head Focus (MHF)|Multi-Head Focus]] with specialized conditioning

MegaContext can adopt DNC's principled approaches to **temporal coherence**, **memory management**, and **specialized attention** while addressing DNC's scalability limitations through hierarchical gist compression and sparse link structures. The path forward involves:

1. **Augment metadata** with temporal link information
2. **Track node usage** to inform allocation decisions
3. **Experiment with multi-head refocusing** strategies
4. **Add temporal coherence** rewards to [[LensNet]] training
5. **Visualize focus dynamics** for debugging and interpretability

These enhancements would give MegaContext DNC-like reasoning capabilities while maintaining scalability to billion-token contexts.
