# Knowledge Distillation (arXiv:1503.02531) — Report

**PDF**: [Knowledge Distillation - 1503.02531.pdf](Knowledge%20Distillation%20-%201503.02531.pdf)

## Overview
- **Title**: Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network
- **Authors**: Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, Jeff Dean (Google)
- **Year**: 2015
- **Core Idea**: Train a smaller "student" model to mimic a large "teacher" model (or ensemble) by learning from its softened output distributions rather than hard labels, transferring "dark knowledge" about class relationships that improve generalization.

## Core Concepts

### Temperature-Scaled Softmax
The key innovation is using a "temperature" parameter T when computing softmax during distillation:

```
q_i = exp(z_i / T) / Σ_j exp(z_j / T)
```

- **T = 1**: Standard softmax (hard targets)
- **T > 1**: "Softens" the distribution, revealing subtle similarities between classes
- During training: High T for distillation loss, T=1 for hard label loss
- At inference: Student uses T=1

### Distillation Loss
Combined objective function:

```
L_total = α * L_soft + (1-α) * L_hard

where:
  L_soft = KL_divergence(student_softT || teacher_softT)
  L_hard = Cross_entropy(student, true_labels)
```

Typical α ≈ 0.9, heavily weighting the soft teacher targets.

### Dark Knowledge
The "dark knowledge" transferred includes:
- **Inter-class similarities**: Which wrong answers are "less wrong"
- **Implicit regularization**: Smoothed distributions prevent overfitting
- **Learned structure**: Patterns the teacher discovered but aren't in hard labels

### Specialist Models
Paper also introduces training specialists on confusable subsets, then distilling them into a single generalist model—relevant for handling class imbalance and focusing compute on hard examples.

## Relevance to MegaContext

### Hierarchical Compression Alignment
Knowledge distillation's core principle—preserving output distributions while reducing model capacity—directly mirrors MegaContext's [[GistNet]] objective:

- **Teacher = base model** processing full token sequences
- **Student = gist embeddings** replacing those sequences
- **Soft targets = continuation distributions** at horizon H
- **Distillation loss ≈ ΔNLL@H** (measuring distribution mismatch)

[[GistNet Training]] already implements a variant of this: we train gists to minimize divergence between base model predictions with/without compression. The temperature-scaling insight suggests we could:

1. **Soften ΔNLL targets** during [[GistNet]] early training to expose subtle dependencies
2. **Curriculum schedule** that gradually lowers temperature as compression improves
3. **Multi-scale distillation** where L2 gists learn from L1's "soft" representations

### LensNet Training Signal
The paper's observation that soft targets carry richer training signal than hard labels applies to [[LensNet]]:

- Instead of binary "expand/collapse" labels, we compute **distributional counterfactuals**
- [[LensNet Scoring]] could benefit from temperature-scaled utility distributions when the optimal action is ambiguous
- Multi-task distillation (expansion utility + collapse utility + keep utility) mirrors the specialist framework

### Ensemble Compression Pathway
The specialist→generalist pipeline maps to potential [[GistNet]] training strategies:

1. Train multiple GistNet specialists on different domains (code, narrative, structured data)
2. Distill them into a single unified GistNet using their soft predictions as targets
3. Maintains domain-specific sensitivity while reducing deployment complexity

This aligns with [[Future Plan#Track B]] goals for domain-adaptive gist encoding.

### Regularization Benefits
Distillation's implicit regularization (preventing overconfident predictions) helps address [[GistNet]] failure modes:

- **Repetitive gist degeneracy**: Softened targets discourage collapsed modes
- **Overfitting to training distribution**: Inter-class similarities preserve generalization
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: Temperature annealing during continual learning

## What We Can Use

### 1. Temperature-Scheduled GistNet Training
Modify [[GistNet Training]] to use temperature-scaled ΔNLL:

```python
def distillation_loss(gist_logits, token_logits, T=2.0):
    """
    Compute KL divergence between gist-conditioned and token-conditioned
    next-token distributions at temperature T.
    """
    gist_probs = F.softmax(gist_logits / T, dim=-1)
    token_probs = F.softmax(token_logits / T, dim=-1)
    return T**2 * F.kl_div(gist_probs.log(), token_probs, reduction='batchmean')
```

**Schedule**: Start T=3.0 (very soft), anneal to T=1.0 (hard) over training. Early phases focus on coarse structure; later phases refine precise substitutability.

### 2. Soft Counterfactual Labeling for LensNet
Extend [[LensNet Training#Counterfactual labeling]] with distributional targets:

```python
# Instead of single scalar utility:
u_expand = -ΔNLL_expand(entry)  # Hard target

# Use softened distribution over utilities:
def soft_utility_target(entry, T=2.0):
    """
    Returns probability distribution over {collapse, keep, expand}
    based on temperature-scaled ΔNLL measurements.
    """
    utilities = {
        'collapse': -ΔNLL_collapse(entry),
        'keep': 0.0,
        'expand': -ΔNLL_expand(entry)
    }
    return softmax(utilities, T=T)
```

Teaches [[LensNet]] to handle uncertain situations where multiple actions have similar utility.

### 3. Specialist Ensemble for Domain Coverage
Train domain-specific [[GistNet]] variants, then distill:

1. **Specialist A**: Code-focused (trained on GitHub, StackOverflow)
2. **Specialist B**: Narrative-focused (trained on BookSum, PG19)
3. **Specialist C**: Structured data (tables, JSON, lists)
4. **Generalist**: Unified GistNet distilled from A+B+C ensemble

Each specialist runs during distillation phase; generalist deploys solo. Captures diverse compression strategies without mixture-of-experts overhead.

### 4. Confidence Calibration via Temperature
Use learned per-block temperature to signal gist confidence:

- High-confidence gists (low perplexity contexts) → T ≈ 1.0
- Low-confidence gists (rare patterns, code switches) → T ≈ 3.0

This metadata feeds into [[LensNet]] as auxiliary conditioning, helping it prioritize expansion of uncertain regions.

## Limitations & Risks

### 1. Teacher Quality Dependence
Distillation cannot recover information the teacher never learned. For MegaContext:

- [[Frozen Base Model|Base model]] is frozen → gist quality ceiling set by base model's original training
- Domain shift (e.g., specialized jargon) may produce poor teacher signals
- Mitigation: Curate diverse distillation corpus, use multiple teacher checkpoints

### 2. Capacity Bottleneck
Student must have sufficient capacity to capture teacher's soft distributions. For [[GistNet]]:

- 32→1 compression is aggressive (96.875% reduction)
- Single-vector gists may underfit complex 32-token semantics
- Mitigation: Two-stage refinement (32→1→32→1), contrastive regularization

### 3. Mode Collapse Risk
Soft targets can over-smooth, leading to generic/repetitive outputs:

- Gists might learn "average" representations that work everywhere but excel nowhere
- Risk increases with very high temperatures (T > 5)
- Mitigation: Entropy regularizers, contrastive loss to maintain diversity

### 4. Temperature Sensitivity
Optimal T varies by task and data:

- Narrative text: T ≈ 2-3 (benefits from smoothing)
- Code: T ≈ 1.5-2 (needs precision)
- Structured data: T ≈ 1-1.5 (schema-sensitive)

Fixed temperature in [[POC Implementation]] may underperform. Need adaptive T per block type or learned per-domain temperatures.

## Open Questions for MegaContext

### 1. Adaptive Temperature Scheduling
How to automatically tune T during [[GistNet Training]]?

- Per-block adaptive T based on source entropy?
- Learned temperature predictor as auxiliary head?
- Domain-specific temperature lookup (code vs prose vs tables)?

### 2. Multi-Horizon Distillation
Current [[ΔNLL@H]] uses fixed horizon H. Could we distill at multiple horizons simultaneously?

```python
L_multi = Σ_h w_h * ΔNLL@h
```

Where w_h weights balance short-term (h=32) vs long-term (h=128) fidelity. Teaches gists to preserve both local coherence and global structure.

### 3. Bidirectional Distillation
Paper focuses on forward predictions. For [[GistNet]], could we also distill **backward** language model predictions?

- Train gists to preserve both future and past context
- Symmetric loss: `L = ΔNLL_forward + ΔNLL_backward`
- Ensures gists capture sufficient information for bidirectional reasoning

### 4. Cross-Level Consistency
Should L2 gists distill from L1's soft outputs, or directly from L0 tokens?

- **Cascaded**: L2 learns from L1 (faster, compounds errors)
- **Direct**: L2 learns from L0 (slower, more faithful)
- **Hybrid**: Multi-task loss with both signals

### 5. Distillation for Focus Allocation
Could we distill an optimal [[Focus Allocator]] policy from expensive search procedures?

1. Run exhaustive beam search over focus configurations offline
2. Collect (context, optimal_focus) pairs
3. Distill into fast [[LensNet]] + greedy allocator
4. Captures complex utility landscapes without online search cost
