## Why This Paper Matters

MegaTexture is the foundational analogy for MegaContext's architecture. Just as MegaTexture streams high-resolution texture data by loading only what's visible to the camera, MegaContext streams relevant context by loading only what matters for the current task. Understanding the original MegaTexture technique helps inform our hierarchical, LOD-based approach to context management.
