# Gist Tokens (arXiv:2304.08467v3) — Report

**PDF**: [Gist Tokens - 2304.08467v3.pdf](Gist%20Tokens%20-%202304.08467v3.pdf)

## Overview
- Introduces **gisting**, a training recipe that teaches an LM to compress long
  prompts into a small set of reusable "gist tokens."
- Compression is achieved by modifying attention masks during instruction
  fine-tuning so that newly introduced gist tokens attend to the prompt while
  the prompt attends back primarily within the gist region.
- Demonstrates up to 26× prompt compression (often using a single token) with
  minimal quality loss on LLaMA-7B and FLAN-T5-XXL, yielding ≈40% FLOPs and
  latency savings when caching gists.

## Core Concepts
- **Attention-masked training**: During finetuning, mask the real prompt from
  seeing the original inputs so the model is forced to represent them through
  the new gist tokens.
- **Reusable caches**: Once trained, a task-specific prompt can be compressed
  once, cached as a short gist prefix, and reused without re-encoding the full
  prompt each time.
- **Quality preservation**: Automatic and human evaluations (ROUGE, GPT-4
  judgements) show small degradation; failures relate to repetitive or
  overfitted gists when capacity is too high.
- **Compute/storage efficiency**: Gains come both from shorter sequences and
  from the ability to reuse gist caches across queries.

## Relevance to MegaContext
- Directly validates our [[GistNet]] architecture goal: compress token spans while
  preserving [[substitutability]]. Their attention-masking trick provides an empirical
  recipe for teaching hierarchical gist compression (see [[GistNet Training]]).
- Suggests a practical path for **prompt macro caching** inside [[Working Context]]—store
  high-value task presets as single-token [[gist|gists]] that can be injected alongside
  retrieved spans, reducing repeated instruction encoding.
- Provides empirical evidence that **aggressive 32→1 compression** can work with minimal
  [[ΔNLL@H]] degradation, validating our [[POC Implementation]] target compression ratios.
- Highlights the need for **quality guards** (detecting degenerate gists), which aligns
  with our [[Telemetry]] requirements for monitoring gist entropy and preventing mode
  collapse during [[GistNet Training]].

## What We Can Use
- Implement a **masked-attention curriculum** during [[GistNet Training]] where gist slots
  must reconstruct downstream predictions without attending to source tokens—forces
  gists to encode sufficient information for [[substitutability]].
- Borrow their **gist caching benchmark** to evaluate FLOPs/latency savings from our
  [[MegaContext Tree]] compression (see [[POC Plan#Phase 3]] success metrics).
- Apply their observation that excessive gist capacity causes overfitting as a design
  constraint: keep gist slots minimal (K=32 → 1 in [[POC Implementation]]) to prevent
  degenerate memorization.
- Extend their **logit divergence measurement** as our primary [[ΔNLL@H]] metric for both
  [[GistNet]] training and [[LensNet]] utility scoring during [[counterfactual labeling]].

## Limitations & Risks
- Training relies on **instruction-tuned data distributions**; domain shift (e.g.,
  specialized code, technical jargon) may degrade compression quality—relevant for
  [[POC Implementation]] where we test on project documentation and code.
- Some gists degenerate into **repetitive boilerplate**, indicating need for entropy
  regularizers or contrastive loss during [[GistNet Training]] (see [[POC Implementation#GistNet Parameters]]).
- Compression quality is **content-dependent**; diverse corpora (code, prose, structured
  data) may require domain-adaptive curricula or specialist [[GistNet]] variants
  (see [[Future Plan#Track B]]).

## Potential Follow-Up Reading
- **LLMLingua / LLMLingua-2** for alternative prompt compression metrics rooted
  in token importance prediction (complements gisting's generative approach).
- **Prompt Caching & Reuse** work from OpenAI/Anthropic (e.g., RePrompting) for
  operational patterns when many prompts share structure.
- **Long-context distillation** papers (e.g., LATS, LongLoRA) to understand how
  compression interacts with retrieval and adaptive context windows.

## Open Questions for MegaContext
- How to blend learned gist tokens with our **hierarchical [[MegaContext Tree]]**—should
  precomputed prompt gists live as pseudo-[[L1]] nodes or as special metadata entries
  that bypass normal compression?
- Can we **precompute domain-specific gists** (e.g., tool instructions, boilerplate) and
  cache them in [[Storage Format]] for instant [[Working Context]] injection, reducing
  cold-start overhead?
- What [[Telemetry]] metrics detect gist drift when the [[frozen base model|base model]]
  is updated—track [[ΔNLL@H]] trends, attention pattern shifts, or embedding cosine
  similarity distributions?
