# Grand Vision

MegaContext aims to virtualize sequence memory so language models can operate with effectively unbounded context at constant compute. The long-term roadmap blends technical depth with practical deployments.

## Why it matters
- **Persistent memory:** Retains lifelong histories without overwhelming GPU budgets by swapping between gists and raw tokens.
- **Dynamic attention:** LensNet-guided focus turns context management into a continual optimization problem rather than one-time summarization.
- **Composable tooling:** Shared data structures enable speculative planning (MegaPrediction), pruning, and visualization without rewriting the stack.

## Future-facing themes
- **Speculative planning:** Operate in a future partition of the gist tree with latent chain-of-thought, hierarchical refinement, and LensNet-guided commits (`MegaPrediction` in the README).
- **Adaptive pruning:** Telemetry-driven strategies collapse stale spans while protecting tagged or high-utility regions.
- **MegaContext + agents:** Agentic workflows can use the working window as a scratchpad while gists preserve context shifts over long projects.

## Where to explore next
- [[plans/Paper Plan]] Phase 3 covers disk-backed storage, telemetry, and pruning hooks.
- [[plans/Future Plan]] Track B outlines co-learning, cognitive cores, and MegaPrediction research.
- [[plans/Future Plan]] Track C/E dive into application showcases and developer experience tooling.
