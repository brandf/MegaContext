## Layer 0 · Capture Summary
- MegaContext integrates compression and focus as part of the runtime, whereas RAG retrieves external text; both can coexist but optimize different contracts.

## Layer 1 · Key Points
- **Storage:** RAG stores documents externally; MegaContext stores hierarchical gists aligned with the model.
- **Trigger:** RAG pulls at query time; MegaContext continuously refocuses via [[LensNet]].
- **Integration:** RAG appends text; MegaContext swaps entries inside the working context.
- **Training:** RAG separates retriever/generator; MegaContext trains substitutability and focus jointly.
- **Collaboration:** RAG can feed MegaContext, which then manages detail internally.

## Layer 2 · Detailed Notes

### High-level comparison

| Aspect | RAG | MegaContext |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Storage** | External documents, often text chunks in a vector DB | Hierarchical learned gists (vectors) directly aligned to the model’s lifetime |
| **Retrieval trigger** | Query-time semantic search | Continuous, learned focus from [[LensNet]] |
| **Integration** | Concatenate retrieved text to prompt | Replace/expand in working context with proper positional encoding |
| **Training** | Separate retriever / generator | Single substitutability & focus training |
| **Memory type** | Stateless look-up | Persistent evolving memory with reversible summarization |

MegaContext treats compression and focus as an integrated learned process rather than retrieval over external text.

### Roleplay conversation: “Isn’t this just RAG?”

(conversation text retained)

**Alex (RAG-first engineer):** Retrieval-augmented pipelines already work. We vector-search the corpus, stick the hits onto the prompt, and keep building products. Do we really need a whole MegaContext stack when RAG can just append more context?

**Sam (MegaContext advocate):** Appending grows the prompt unbounded. MegaContext keeps a *fixed* working window and focuses/defocuses inline. [[LensNet]] learns when to zoom in or out, so memories migrate inside the context instead of piling up at the tail. That’s a different contract entirely.

**Jordan (systems architect, middle ground):** Append vs inline focus has downstream effects. Appends can accumulate distractors, but they’re easy to reason about. Learned focus promises better signal-to-noise, yet we inherit the responsibility of training that policy. It’s a trade-off, not a free lunch.

**Alex:** Fine, but RAG captures conversation history too—just serialize the transcript and stick summaries into a DB. The agent can query that like any other doc.

**Sam:** MegaContext doesn’t distinguish “conversation” from “memory.” Every turn is automatically captured, gisted, and treated identically to preloaded core knowledge. The MegaContext tree is one substrate. With RAG, you orchestrate two separate stores—dialogue state and retrievable docs—and wire bespoke rules between them.

**Jordan:** That orchestration complexity is real, although it gives you knobs. Some teams like explicit pipelines (transcript summary → retrieval rules → appended context). MegaContext collapses it into learned behaviour; updates happen organically, but we give up hard-coded guardrails.

**Alex:** What about deciding which details matter? In RAG we can handcraft ranking functions, heuristics, or agent tooling. Training new networks sounds expensive.

**Sam:** In MegaContext the level-of-detail policy is trained end-to-end: LensNet learns which spans to expand or evict, using counterfactual ΔNLL labels. RAG’s relevance scoring is usually heuristic—BM25, embedding cosine, symbolic rules. Those work, but they aren’t adapting to the base model’s actual loss landscape.

**Jordan:** Learned vs heuristic control echoes the classic “model-free vs rules” debate. Heuristics are transparent; the learned policy can drift yet potentially squeeze more accuracy. The right choice probably depends on available telemetry and risk tolerance.

**Alex:** Summaries are another point. RAG stores text so the LLM just reads it—no special embedding logic needed.

**Sam:** MegaContext upgrades the embedding space itself. [[GistNet]] emits latent vectors aligned with the base model’s embeddings, so the LLM consumes compressed semantics directly. Text summaries cost more tokens and lose nuance; gists carry richer detail per slot.

**Jordan:** That’s appealing, but means you must maintain the gist encoder alongside the base model. Text chunks are portable; latent gists tie you to the MegaContext stack.

**Alex:** Lastly, RAG can only append. But does defocusing really help? Feels like overkill.

**Sam:** Defocus is the whole point. When the user pivots topics, the working context can shed irrelevant spans and pull in the right detail—like a neural chain-of-thought that re-centres on each query. RAG keeps old snippets; they become distractors or get repeatedly summarized.

**Jordan:** That dynamic focus could be a differentiator, especially for multi-turn reasoning. Still, append-only retrieval is battle-tested and simpler to debug. Maybe the sweet spot is using RAG to surface fresh evidence *and* letting MegaContext decide how it lives in memory.

**Alex:** So the pitch isn’t “MegaContext replaces RAG,” it’s “MegaContext manages memory once the data arrives,” right?

**Sam:** Exactly. Use RAG or tools to find new facts, ingest them into the MegaContext tree, and let learned focus maintain a compact working set. Two layers working together rather than competing.

**Jordan:** Sounds like convergence then—a pragmatic pipeline might retrieve with RAG, gist with MegaContext, and rely on LensNet to mediate detail. Understanding the division of labour helps us reuse what already works while exploring the new focus controller.

## Layer 3 · Change Log
- 2025-10-22: Added metadata, layered summaries, and inline links to focus/compression modules.
