- Capture quick bullets and links in the summary section of a note; mark `status:: capture`.
- Process by promoting raw captures to dedicated concept notes with metadata (title, type, status, tags, summary, links).
- Refine using progressive summarization: keep the summary concise, add TL;DR bullet lists, and elaborate in Details.
- Create and publish outputs (README updates, demos, reports) and update note status (`active`, `done`).
- Instrument the workflow with Dataview queries (e.g., `table status where type="concept"`) to track backlog and publishing pipeline.
