# GistNet Architecture Details

This document captures the plan-of-record implementation of **GistNet**, the 32→1 compressor that transforms short token spans into substitutable gists for the [[MegaContext Tree]]. The Phase 1 code path (see `mc/gistnet.py`) standardises on a mini transformer backbone plus interchangeable pooling heads.

## Architectural Overview

```mermaid

    subgraph Window
        T[Token embeddings<br/>(32 × d)]
    end
    CLS[(optional CLS token)]
    subgraph Backbone
        B1[RoPE + LayerNorm]
        B2[Transformer Block × N<br/>(MHA + MLP + residuals)]
    end
    Head[[Pooling Head<br/>(mean · query · CLS)]]
    G[gist ∈ ℝ^d]

    T --> B1 --> B2 --> Head --> G
    T -. prepend .-> CLS --> B1
```

1. **Inputs.** The base model’s embedding layer provides `[B, 32, d]` slices. Local RoPE metadata is applied directly to those embeddings.  
2. **Mini transformer stack.** We reuse nanochat’s attention/MLP blocks (pre-LN, residual connections, rotary queries/keys) with `n_layer = 1–4` and `n_head = 8` by default. GistNet never touches KV caches because each window is processed independently.  
3. **Pooling head.** The final `[B, 32, d]` activations are collapsed into one gist via one of three heads:
   - **Mean pooling** (baseline) → linear or two-layer MLP projection.
   - **Query pooling** → learned query attends once over the block (Structured Self-Attentive pooling [1]).
   - **CLS pooling** → prepend a learnable `[CLS]` token before the backbone and read it afterwards (BERT-style [2]).

The result is a `d`-dimensional vector aligned with the base LLM’s embedding space so we can splice it directly into the context.

## Transformer Backbone

| Parameter | Value (run10 default) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Window length | 32 tokens | Fixed to match MegaContext block size. |
| Embedding dim `d` | Matches base model (`depth * 64`) | Pulled directly from nanochat config. |
| Layers `n_layer` | 2 | Can be tuned per script. |
| Heads `n_head` | 8 | Full multi-head attention (no MQA). |
| RoPE base | 10 000 | Shared with nanochat GPT. |

Each block performs:

```
x = x + MHA( norm(x), rotary=True )
x = x + MLP( norm(x) )
```

with bf16 activations and fp32 parameters. There is no slot/cross-attention anymore; all mixing happens through self-attention inside the window.

## Pooling Heads

| Head name | Summary | Projection | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mean_linear` | Mean of the block | Linear | “Dumb” control baseline (`mean_linear`). |
| `mean_mlp` | Mean + 2-layer MLP | Linear→ReLU→Linear | Default for transformer families (`transformer2_mean_mlp`). |
| `query_linear` | Learned query attends once (Lin et al. 2017 [1]) | Linear | Adds negligible FLOPs. |
| `query_mlp` | Same as above | Linear→ReLU→Linear | Preferred when accuracy > cost. |
| `cls_linear` | Prepend `[CLS]`, read directly (Devlin et al. 2018 [2]) | Linear | Sequence length +1, cheap. |
| `cls_mlp` | Same as above | Linear→ReLU→Linear | Highest-capacity pooling. |

Every head reports whether it requires a `[CLS]` token so the runtime can prepend it exactly once.

### FLOPs Estimate (run10)

| Variant | FLOPs / block (×10⁶) | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transformer2_mean_mlp` | ~12.6 | Default; best accuracy/cost for depth‑2. |
| `transformer2_query_mlp` | ~13.2 | Depth‑2 + query pooling. |
| `transformer2_cls_mlp` | ~13.0 | Depth‑2 + CLS token. |
| `transformer2_mean_linear` | ~10.2 | Smallest transformer head (depth‑2). |
| `transformer2_query_linear` | ~10.8 | Query pooling w/out MLP (depth‑2). |
| `transformer2_cls_linear` | ~10.6 | CLS pooling w/out MLP (depth‑2). |
| `transformer4_mean_mlp` | ~25.0 | Depth‑4 heavy tier (≈2× layers). |
| `transformer4_query_mlp` | ~26.4 | Depth‑4 + query pooling. |
| `transformer4_cls_mlp` | ~26.0 | Depth‑4 + CLS token. |
| `transformer4_mean_linear` | ~20.4 | Depth‑4 linear head. |
| `transformer4_query_linear` | ~21.2 | Query pooling on depth‑4 stack. |
| `transformer4_cls_linear` | ~21.0 | CLS pooling on depth‑4 stack. |
| `mean_linear` | ~1.2 | No transformer; sanity baseline only. |

## Hierarchical Application

1. **LOD0 (tokens → gists).** Run the transformer head on raw token embeddings.  
2. **LOD1 (gists → super-gists).** Take groups of 32 LOD0 gists, feed them back through the same module (weights can be shared) to get LOD1 gists.  
3. **LOD≥2.** Repeat as required: every extra level adds `log₃₂` compression and still uses the identical code path, only swapping the input tensor source.

This produces a MegaContext tree where every node is generated by the same transformer head, vastly simplifying maintenance compared to the old slot/cross-attention pipeline.

## Implementation Notes

- **File:** `mc/gistnet.py` (imported by `mc/runtime.MCController`).  
- **Config knobs:** `--gistnet transformer2_*|transformer4_*|mean_linear` from `run10.sh` / `speedrun.sh`.  
- **Device placement:** GistNet runs on the same device as the base model embeddings (CUDA). Metadata (positions, LOD) stays on-device to avoid PCIe traffic.  
- **Telemetry:** Use `nanochat.report` counters to log gist substitution ΔNLL and pooling head choice per run.
