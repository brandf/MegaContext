summary: Extends MegaContext to images by building 2D gist hierarchies, adapting positional encodings, and integrating visual spans into the mixed-LOD working context.

![[MultimodalMegaContext.png]]

MegaContext can virtualize more than text. This note sketches how we ingest images, compress them into hierarchical gists, and align their positional signals so the frozen or co-trained base model can reason over massive visual memories alongside language.

## Why images need special treatment

- **2D structure:** Image patches carry spatial relationships that raster order alone cannot preserve.
- **Scale explosion:** High-resolution captures (target: 1B×1B) require mipmap-style pyramids to keep storage and compute manageable.
- **Mixed modalities:** Visual gists must coexist with textual entries inside the [[Working Context]] while obeying the same budget and invariants.

To serve multimodal runs, we extend the [[MegaContext Tree]] and [[Positional Encoding]] scheme to understand 2D positions and multi-channel embeddings.

## Building hierarchical visual gists

1. **Patch tokenization**
   - Start from a ViT-style encoder that maps fixed-size patches (e.g., 16×16 pixels) to embedding vectors.
   - Maintain per-patch metadata: `(x, y)` indices, resolution level, color statistics, modality tags.

2. **2D block grouping**
   - Instead of 1D 32-token spans, form 2D tiles (e.g., 8×8 patch blocks = 64 patches) that become the unit for compression.
   - Each tile feeds a **Visual GistNet** variant with separable 2D attention (row/column mixing) and optionally cross-attention to textual cues already present in the working view.

3. **Mipmap-style hierarchy**
   - Stack levels analogous to GPU texture mipmaps: each parent summarizes a 2×2 grid of child tiles, yielding quad-tree fan-out.
   - Persist L0 (patch embeddings), L1 (tile gists), L2+ (mipmap gists) in parallel buffers within the MegaContext storage layout so they can be streamed independently.

4. **Cross-modal linking**
   - Attach references from gists back to aligned textual spans (captions, OCR tokens), enabling [[LensNet]] to co-reason across modalities when assigning focus scores.
   - Store provenance metadata in [[Node Metadata]] to preserve auditability.

This structure mirrors the textual hierarchy but respects image topology, enabling the [[Focus Allocator]] to expand or collapse spatial regions as needed.

## Positional encoding for images

Visual entries combine **global MegaContext indices** with **local 2D coordinates**:

- **Global index:** Every image ingest event receives a base index, keeping chronological ordering consistent with text and allowing ALiBi biases to operate across modalities. See [[Positional Encoding#Near-term retrofit (POC)]].
- **Local 2D encoding:** Within each image, we apply a 2D rotary or sine-cosine scheme (separate phases for x and y). For gists, we pool the mean position and attach scale parameters `(σ_x, σ_y)` describing footprint size.
- **Gaussian extension:** When [[Positional Encoding#Long-term architecture (Gaussian RoPE)]] lands, image gists set σ terms based on tile width/height, naturally blurring high frequencies in both axes.
- **Slow-band disambiguation:** Extremely large images layer ultra-slow rotary bands per axis so distant patches remain distinguishable even after mipmap compression.

Runtime integration inserts these signals alongside text positions before the base model consumes a multimodal working context.

## Working context integration

- **Budget accounting:** Assign modality-aware costs (e.g., treat a visual tile gist as 1 token-equivalent for budget balance). Mixed batches of text and image entries remain contiguous in chronological order.
- **Focus coordination:** [[LensNet]] extends its input schema to include modality flags, 2D extents, and cross-modal attention summaries, letting it compare textual relevance against visual signals.
- **Expansion policy:** The [[Focus Allocator]] can refine a coarse visual gist into its child grid, similar to expanding text gists into L0 tokens, while respecting cooldowns and spatial contiguity.

This keeps inference uniform: the base model still sees a single sequence, but entries carry modality-specific embeddings and positional metadata.

## Future directions

- **Ultra-large imagery:** For 1B×1B inputs, ingest occurs in streaming passes (tiled IO) that populate the MegaContext hierarchy level by level, using GPU texture hardware or CUDA kernels for efficiency.
- **Learned cross-modal gists:** Co-train textual and visual gist encoders so captions influence which visual regions stay detailed.
- **Multimodal telemetry:** Extend [[Telemetry]] to record focus hit rates per modality, positional stretch usage, and ΔNLL deltas when swapping visual LODs.
- **Speculative rendering:** Combine with [[MegaPrediction]] to queue future visual edits or annotations in a separate branch before committing to history.
