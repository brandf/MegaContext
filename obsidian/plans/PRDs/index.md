# MegaContext PRD Index

> **All entries are plan-of-record (POR).** Update the linked PRDs + [[PRD Progress Tracker]] whenever requirements change or implementation work lands.

Quick reference for the current MegaContext product requirement documents:

1. [[MegaContext End-to-End Training]] — Unified training plan covering horizon evaluation, ΔNLL supervision, and gist-level losses for the full MegaContext loop.
2. [[MegaAttention Training]] — Extending sparse attention with hierarchical attention via [[GistNet]]
3. [[MegaPrediction Training]] — Roadmap for the multi-LOD decoding head that forecasts gist vectors alongside tokens to enable gist-first inference paths.
4. [[Cognitive-Core Training]] — Strategy for the cognitive-core model that externalizes knowledge into composable MegaContexts and evaluates composite focus behavior.
5. [[Hierarchical KV Caching Strategy]] - Strategy for efficiently updating KV caches as the [[Focus Allocator]] performs edits.
6. [[PRD Progress Tracker]] — Status board summarizing progress, blockers, and next steps for each PRD.
