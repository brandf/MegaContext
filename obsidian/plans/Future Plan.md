- Long-range roadmap for scaling MegaContext beyond the research paper milestone.

## TL;DR
- Track A drives platform maturity and ecosystem tooling.
- Track B pushes co-learning, speculative planning, and joint training.
- Track C highlights application showcases across coding, knowledge, multimodal use cases.
- Track D invests in comparative research, benchmarks, and governance.
- Track E focuses on developer experience, visualization, and automation.

## Details

Canonical post-paper roadmap for MegaContext.

This milestone captures post-paper ambitions: scaling MegaContext for production usage, expanding research directions, and supporting broader adoption. Items here may require substantial engineering, large-scale training, or additional publications.

## Track A — Platform Maturation & Ecosystem
- **A.1 Multi-Model Support**
  - Add portability tooling for new frozen bases (Qwen family, LLaMA 3, Mixtral variants).
  - Provide automated compatibility tests (`pytest -m portability`) covering tokenization quirks, attention masks, and precision settings.
  - Ship pre-made configs and scripts (`tools/port_model.py`) for rapid onboarding of new LLMs/VLMs.
- **A.2 Production Storage & Deployment**
  - Harden MegaContext storage with sharding, replication, and cloud object-store backends.
  - Integrate async disk streaming and caching for low-latency serving.
  - Provide observability dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana) and alerting policies for memory growth, gist variance, and focus anomalies.
- **A.3 API & SDK**
  - Design language-agnostic SDKs (Python, TypeScript) exposing ingestion, focus control, and provenance queries.
  - Offer hosted service templates (FastAPI/gRPC) with authentication, rate limiting, and billing hooks.

## Track B — Advanced Learning & Co-Optimization
- **B.1 EM-Style Co-Learning**
  - Continue alternating optimization cycles across gist, lens, and lightweight LoRA adapters; experiment with adaptive cycle scheduling and early stopping.
  - Extend to >8 B base models when compute becomes available; explore distributed training strategies.
- **B.2 Cognitive Core & Agentic Reasoning**
  - Train compact cognitive core transformers capable of mixed token/gist reasoning, seeded from POC/PAPER infrastructure.
  - Develop agentic loops (planning, tool use) that leverage MegaContext for multi-turn tasks; integrate uncertainty estimates to trigger focus adjustments.
- **B.3 Training LLMs from Scratch**
  - Research joint training regimes where base models learn with MegaContext from the outset, potentially using synthetic long-context curricula.
  - Investigate curriculum schedules, scaling laws, and data filtering tailored to gist-aware transformers.
- **B.4 MegaPrediction Speculative Planning**
  - Extend the MegaContext tree with a movable present cursor separating committed history from speculative future gists and tokens.
  - Prototype latent CoT planners, hierarchical de-gisting, and LensNet-guided refinement loops that operate in the speculative region before committing outputs.
  - Reuse ΔNLL and RL-style objectives to score finalized continuations while tracking compute/latency costs accrued during prediction.

## Track C — Application Showcases & Verticalization
- **C.1 Coding Assistant Showcase**
  - Complete the repository-ingest pipeline, live watcher service, and coding-agent CLI.
  - Benchmark on HumanEval, MBPP, and repo-level tasks with and without MegaContext memory.
  - Produce demos highlighting focus reallocations over large codebases.
- **C.2 Knowledge Workflows**
  - Build “core knowledge” MegaContexts blending documentation, specs, incident reports, and conversation logs with rich metadata.
  - Implement retrieval + focus hybrids for question answering, compliance auditing, or customer support.
- **C.3 Multimodal & Layout-Rich Use Cases**
  - Explore fusing non-text signals (UI traces, diagrams) into the gist hierarchy.
  - Leverage insights from optical compression research (e.g., DeepSeek-OCR) to capture layout metadata or render-on-demand fallbacks without full rasterization pipelines.

## Track D — Research Extensions
- **D.1 Comparative Studies & Additional Papers**
  - Investigate MegaContext vs. alternative memory systems (RETRO, MEMGPT) across more domains.
  - Publish follow-on papers focused on pruning strategies, focus allocator learning, or cognitive core performance.
- **D.2 Community Benchmarks**
  - Curate open long-context benchmarks and leaderboards featuring MegaContext variants.
  - Provide evaluation harness integrations (Helm, LongEval) to encourage external replication.
- **D.3 Ethical, Safety, and Governance**
  - Study provenance retention, audit trails, and compliance implications of long-lived memories.
  - Propose policy and safety guidelines for organizations adopting MegaContext at scale.

## Track E — Tooling & Developer Experience
- **E.1 Visualization Enhancements**
  - Build interactive MegaContext explorers (web + terminal) with drill-down, playback, and annotation capabilities.
- **E.2 Automation & CI**
  - Create scripted workflows (Makefile/Invoke) covering ingestion, training, evaluation, and release packaging.
  - Integrate long-context regression tests into CI with synthetic datasets and seeded RNG.
- **E.3 Documentation Portal**
  - Launch a docs site (mkdocs or similar) consolidating architecture guides, API references, tutorials, and research insights.

These tracks are intentionally broad; teams should prioritize based on community demand, resource availability, and outcomes of the research paper milestone.
