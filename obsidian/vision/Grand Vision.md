summary: Articulates why MegaContext matters long term and the future directions it unlocks.
---
MegaContext virtualizes memory to enable smaller, continually updated models; this vision note outlines why that matters and where the architecture goes next.

---

- **Persistent memory:** unbounded history at constant compute.
- **Dynamic attention:** learned focus policies via [[LensNet]] + [[Focus Allocator]].
- **Composable tooling:** shared structures power [[MegaPrediction]] and pruning.
- **Virtually infinite memory:** years-long conversations without retraining.
- **Core knowledge:** treat MegaContext as an updatable system prompt.
- **Agentic workflows:** richer coding/knowledge agents, persistent tasks.

## Details

MegaContext aims to virtualize sequence memory so language models can operate with effectively unbounded context at constant compute. The long-term roadmap blends technical depth with practical deployments.

---
## Why it matters

- **Persistent memory:** retains lifelong histories without overwhelming GPU budgets by swapping between gists and raw tokens.
- **Dynamic attention:** LensNet-guided focus turns context management into a continual optimization problem rather than one-time summarization.
- **Composable tooling:** shared data structures enable speculative planning ([[MegaPrediction]]), pruning, and visualization without rewriting the stack.
- **Virtually infinite memory:** the MegaContext can grow unbounded while per-step compute and GPU RAM remain constant. A conversation could persist for years without retraining or forgetting.
- **Smaller, smarter models:** an LLM trained end-to-end with MegaContext could shift parameter budget away from memorized facts toward reasoning, abstraction, and planning. Knowledge lives in the MegaContext memory instead of the weights.
- **Agentic coding & persistent tasks:** treating context management as a first-class component enables long-lived projects without manual summarization or brittle RAG pipelines.
- **Core knowledge as dynamic system prompt:** a curated MegaContext becomes a massive, updatable system prompt that evolves independently of model weights.

## Future-facing themes

- **Speculative planning:** operate in a future partition of the gist tree with latent chain-of-thought, hierarchical refinement, and LensNet-guided commits (see [[MegaPrediction]]).
- **Adaptive pruning:** telemetry-driven strategies collapse stale spans while protecting tagged or high-utility regions (see [[MegaCuration]]).
- **MegaContext + agents:** agentic workflows can use the working window as a scratchpad while gists preserve context shifts over long projects.
- **[[MegaPrediction]]-ready agents:** predicted gists and draft tokens live alongside history in the tree, separated by a movable “present” cursor so the system can iterate on future context, then commit finalized outputs back into the past timeline.
- **[[MegaCuration]] for living knowledge:** run LensNet across large MegaContext partitions, aggregate focus telemetry per span, and iteratively prune only the lowest-signal leaves while retaining higher-level gists to build core knowledge trees tailored to real usage.
