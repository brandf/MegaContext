# MegaContext Vault Home

MegaContext virtualizes long-context memory for frozen LLMs by mixing raw tokens with hierarchical gists inside a fixed working window. Use this vault to capture design notes, experiments, and planning updates that complement the codebase.

## Working ground rules
- The repoâ€™s conceptional source of truth is still `README.md`; mirror anything that affects API or architecture there in addition to these notes.
- Store collaborative diagrams in `assets/` and reference them from here with relative paths; keep transient sketches in this vault.
- Track roadmap adjustments in `planning/` markdown files before reflecting additional context here.

## Context snapshots
- **MegaContext vs working context:** A persistent gist tree stores the full interaction history while a budgeted working window feeds the frozen base model (`[[Architecture Overview]]` dives deeper).
- **Dynamic focus:** LensNet and the focus allocator decide when to expand or collapse spans, ensuring the working window stays within the allotted token cost (`[[Runtime Loop]]` covers the loop).
- **Compression layers:** GistNet converts 32-token blocks into gists, enabling multi-level detail representations that the system can swap in on demand (`[[Core Components]]` outlines each module).
