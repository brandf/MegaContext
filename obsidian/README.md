# Obsidian Vault

This directory hosts the shared Obsidian vault for MegaContext design notes and canvases.

- Open `obsidian/` from Obsidian to load the vault alongside the codebase. Start at `[[Home]]` for quick links into the curated notes.
- Store markdown notes, canvases (`*.canvas`), and supporting diagrams you want to share with the team here.
- The local `.obsidian/` settings folder is ignored from version control so everyone can keep personal UI preferences; commit only the artifacts meant for collaboration.

Keep the existing documentation guidelines in mind: long-lived diagrams still belong in `assets/`, and architecture or API changes should continue to be mirrored in `README.md` or the planning docs.
