# MegaContext Product Code Review

This review is now split by difficulty so we can parallelize execution:

- [[mc_product_code_review_easy|Quick Wins (Codex-Medium)]]
- [[mc_product_code_review_hard|Deep Work (Codex-High)]]

Use the quick-wins doc for fast fixes (docs, CLI flags, inference smoke tests) and the deep-work doc for the structural/performance issues that require dedicated focus.
